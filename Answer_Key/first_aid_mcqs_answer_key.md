117. b) Try to calm and reassure the casualty. Encourage them to slow their breathing. Sometimes breathing slowly into cupped hands or a paper bag (for a very short period, under supervision, and if not asthmatic or having heart problems) can help, but this is controversial and should be used with caution. Focus on calm, slow breaths.
118. b) Move the casualty to a cooler, less humid environment. Keep the affected area dry. Wear loose cotton clothing. Cool baths or showers can help. Calamine lotion or hydrocortisone cream (low strength) may soothe.

136. b) Advise them to avoid blowing their nose, picking it, or strenuous activity for several hours to prevent re-bleeding. If it re-starts and is heavy or prolonged, seek medical advice.
137. b) Clean the area. If a small part of the splinter is protruding, you may be able to grasp it with sterile tweezers and gently pull it out in the direction it entered. If not, or if it breaks, or if very painful, soak the finger in warm water for a few minutes several times a day to see if it works its way out or softens the skin. Seek medical advice if it doesn_t come out or signs of infection appear.
138. b) Follow RICE: Rest the injured part. Apply Ice (cold pack wrapped in cloth) for 15-20 minutes every 2-3 hours. Apply Compression with an elastic bandage (not too tight). Elevate the injured limb above the level of the heart if possible.
